    <p class="para">Hear this, in the gentle hush of the garden winds:
The Princess has drawn the Hibiscus — a bloom of warmth, courage, and quiet beauty.

Not all flowers are chosen by chance; some are guided by the whispers of fate. And today, fate has bowed before her. For the hibiscus blooms not for the proud or the loud, but for the kind-hearted, the strong-spirited, and the ones who carry sunlight in their soul.

O Princess of the Crimson Bloom,
Let its petals remind you: even in stillness, there is power. Even in softness, there is fire.

Congratulations, noble one.
The realm rejoices — for the flower has found its rightful keeper.</p>
