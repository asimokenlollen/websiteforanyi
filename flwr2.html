   <h2>TULIP</h2>
    <h3> The Scarlet Dagger</h3>

    <p class="para">The Princess has been graced with the Tulip — a flower of fierce beauty and quiet majesty.

Not merely a bloom, the tulip is a symbol of courage wrapped in velvet, of a heart that burns with the fire of a thousand sunsets. It is the mark of one who walks with purpose, whose spirit shines even in the darkest hours.

O radiant Princess, bearer of the Tulip’s flame,
May its petals remind you of your strength and grace,
And may your reign be as bold and breathtaking as the blossom itself.

Congratulations, noble soul.
The kingdom rejoices — for the Tulip has found its true queen</p>
